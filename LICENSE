This license WILL change.

Since v0.9:
	First and foremost: I claim no responsibility for what this extension does to anyone or anything or any data.  I have attempted to make it both safe and accurate to its goals, but I make no legally-binding-claim to that effect.  I can and will promise that this extension will not now or ever transmit personal information without explicit, obvious consent by the user, and likely not ever at all, TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE.  This may become a collaborative project, and I will review all code that goes into it for malicious intent, but I can not and will not make a categorical guarantee to this end.
	I'm releasing the source so others may duplicate what I've done, or learn from it (though you may pick up my bad habits).  Anyone, for any reason, may duplicate code from this project for their own use. Because it is so simple in its current state, you're even free to claim you came up with *your* copy - the morality of which is determined by you, probably hinging on how much you've changed it.  I would appreciate attribution in some form or another, as long as it is readable without special tools, but I am not now requiring it.
	The above terms will change.
